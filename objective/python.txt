Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purposeprogramming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpretedlanguage, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notablyusing whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets orkeywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines ofcode than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.
